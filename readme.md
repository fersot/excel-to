# Laravel Excel to JSON / Collection / Array

This Laravel package provides utilities for converting Excel files to JSON format, Laravel Collections, or PHP Arrays. It also supports reading data from multiple sheets within an Excel file.

## Installation

You can install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require fersot/excel-to
```

## Usage

### JSON Conversion

To convert an Excel file to JSON format, use the `json` method of the `ExcelTo` class:

```php
use Fersot\ExcelTo\ExcelTo;

$jsonData = ExcelTo::json('path/to/your/excel_file.xlsx');
```

This will return a JSON-encoded string representing the Excel data. If the Excel file contains multiple sheets, the data will be organized by sheet names.

### Collection Conversion

To convert an Excel file to a Laravel Collection, use the `collection` method of the `ExcelTo` class:

```php
use Fersot\ExcelTo\ExcelTo;

$collection = ExcelTo::collection('path/to/your/excel_file.xlsx');
```

This will return a Laravel Collection containing the Excel data. When multiple sheets are present, each sheet's data will be a collection keyed by the sheet name.

### Array Conversion

To convert an Excel file to a PHP Array, use the `array` method of the `ExcelTo` class:

```php
use Fersot\ExcelTo\ExcelTo;

$arrayData = ExcelTo::array('path/to/your/excel_file.xlsx');
```

This will return a PHP array containing the Excel data. Similar to JSON and Collection, multiple sheets will be keyed by their names.

## Example

```php
use Fersot\ExcelTo\ExcelTo;

// Convert Excel to JSON
$jsonData = ExcelTo::json('path/to/your/excel_file.xlsx');

// Convert Excel to Collection
$collection = ExcelTo::collection('path/to/your/excel_file.xlsx');

// Convert Excel to Array
$arrayData = ExcelTo::array('path/to/your/excel_file.xlsx');
```
